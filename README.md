Opera Tweet Extension
=====================

Simple tweeting extension for Opera. 

Description
-----------
- icon badge shows how many tweets were made for current URL
    - uses http://urls.api.twitter.com/1/urls/count.json to determine tweet count
    - counts are cached for 30 minutes
- clicking on icon open popup with prefilled page title and URL
- if there is a selection on current tab, that is used as tweet prefill

Motivation
----------
My tweeting happens almost always like this: 

1. select and copy text on page (article name/title)
2. paste it into tweet box
3. copy URL
4. past it into tweet box
5. add comment

With this extension it's down to (because title is often what I'm selecting):

1. click extension icon
2. comment
